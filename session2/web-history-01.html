        <h2>History of the Web</h2>
        <h3>EARLY 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>

        <p>The Mundaneum was an institution which aimed to gather together all the world's knowledge and classify it
            according to a system called the Universal Decimal Classification. It was developed at the turn of the 20th
            century by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. The Mundaneum has been identified as a
            milestone in the history of data collection and management, and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to
            the Internet...</p>

        <h3>1945, Memex, Vannevar Bush</h3>
        <p>A memex is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting
            with microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "As We May Think". Bush envisioned
            the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and
            communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". The
            individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex "an
            enlarged intimate supplement to his memory".[1]</p>

        <h3>1960s, Project Xanadu “hypertext”, ted nelson</h3>
        <p>Project Xanadu was the first hypertext project, founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson.
            Administrators of Project Xanadu declared it superior to the World Wide Web, with the mission statement:
            "Today's popular software simulates paper. The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper) trivialises our
            original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents."</p>

        <h3>1960s, The birth of the Internet ARPANET</h3>
        <p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switched network with
            distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both
            technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced
            Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.</p>

        <h3>1971, First email, Ray Tomlinson</h3>
        <p>Much like the first telegraph or phone call, the first email marked an historic moment in the evolution of
            communication. Unfortunately, the message itself was less than earth shattering. The text of that first
            electronic missive consisted of "something like QWERTYUIOP."Sent by computer engineer Ray Tomlinson (April
            23, 1941 - March 5, 2016) in 1971, the email was simply a
            test message to himself. The email was sent from one computer to another computer sitting right beside it in
            Cambridge, Massachusetts, but it traveled via ARPANET, a network of computers that was the precursor to the
            Internet.</p>

        <h3>1983, Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP), Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn</h3>
        <p>The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is the backbone of the internet and modern
            networking. Conceived in the 1970s by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, this protocol suite has underpinned the
            development of the digital world as we know it, allowing disparate networks to communicate through
            standardized rules for data exchange.</p>

        <h3>1989, Invention of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at the European Council for
            Nuclear
            Research (CERN)</h3>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The
            Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between
            scientists in universities and institutes around the world. CERN is not an isolated laboratory, but rather
            the focal point for an extensive community that includes more than 17 000 scientists from over 100
            countries. Although they typically spend some time on the CERN site, the scientists usually work at
            universities and national laboratories in their home countries. Reliable communication tools are therefore
            essential. The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of computers, data networks and
            hypertext into a powerful and easy to use global information system.</p>

        <h3>1990, Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
        <p>Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first
            successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in
            mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped
            foster the Web's subsequent development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith)
            the World Wide Web Foundation. In 2009, he was elected Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
            Sciences.</p>

        <h3>1991, First Website Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
        <p>With the core technologies and tools in place, the final step was to create the first webpage. On December
            20, 1990, Tim Berners-Lee published the first website on his NeXT server. The address was
            http://info.cern.ch. Initially, it was only accessible to those within the CERN network. It wasn’t until
            August 1991 that he announced the project on public internet newsgroups, making it available to the world.

        <h3>1990, The first search engine, Alan Emtage Archie index</h3>
        <p>Archie is a tool for indexing FTP archives, allowing users to more easily identify specific files. It is
            considered the first Internet search engine. The original implementation was written in 1990 by Alan
            Emtage, then a postgraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Archie was
            superseded by other, more sophisticated search engines, including Jughead and Veronica, which were search
            engines for the Gopher protocol. These were in turn superseded by World Wide Web search engines like
            AltaVista and directories like Yahoo! in 1995. Work on Archie ceased in the late 1990s. A legacy Archie
            server was maintained for historic purposes in Poland at Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and
            Computational Modelling in the University of Warsaw until 2023.</p>

        <h3> 1992, The first photo on the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
        <p>You might expect that the first photo on the web would’ve something historical, maybe a picture taken by a
            famous photographer. But instead, de Gennaro handed off that album cover he’d done for the Cernettes. Tim
            Berners Lee was a fan of the band, so when it came time to upload the first photo to the web, the Cernettes
            got the honor of being the first photo on the web...</p>

        <h3>1997, The invention of Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 WIFI standard</h3>
        <p>802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely
            accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax. Other standards in the family
            (c–f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which
            amendments may also include corrections to a previous specification.</p>
